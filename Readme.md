# Gas Fee Optimizer: Move Smart Contract

## Introduction  
The **Gas Fee Optimizer** is a simple yet effective Move-based smart contract designed to introduce gas fee discounts for users interacting with the blockchain. By allowing users to set a gas fee discount percentage, this contract empowers developers to create a more cost-efficient and user-friendly ecosystem, encouraging broader adoption of decentralized applications (dApps).

This contract uses the Aptos blockchain's core modules, ensuring compatibility and leveraging Aptos' fast and secure framework.

## Vision  
The **Gas Fee Optimizer** project envisions a blockchain ecosystem where gas fees are no longer a barrier to participation. By enabling flexible fee structures, the project aims to:
- Enhance accessibility for new users entering the blockchain space.
- Encourage innovation by reducing the cost burden for developers and users.
- Foster a fair and sustainable transaction fee mechanism that adapts to diverse user needs.

## Future Goals  
To further our vision, we aim to:
1. **Dynamic Fee Adjustment**  
   Introduce advanced algorithms to dynamically adjust discounts based on transaction volume, network load, or user loyalty.

2. **Incentive Mechanism**  
   Reward frequent users or those contributing significantly to the ecosystem by offering higher discounts.

3. **Multichain Support**  
   Expand the Gas Fee Optimizer to other blockchains, creating a unified and seamless experience across platforms.

4. **Analytics Dashboard**  
   Build an analytics platform to track user savings and project performance metrics.

5. **Community Governance**  
   Enable community-driven decision-making to determine discount policies and thresholds.
